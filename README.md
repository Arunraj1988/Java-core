## ðŸ“š<u> Library Management System (LMS) â€“ Java
### Overview

This is a simple Library Management System (LMS) built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SOLID design.
It is an in-memory application (no database required) and demonstrates Repository Pattern, Strategy Pattern, and clean architecture.

The system manages:

- Books (add, update, search, delete)
- Patrons/Users (registration, update, borrowing history)
- Branches (multi-branch support, inventory per branch)
- Loans (checkout, return, overdue detection, fine calculation)
- Reservations (book reservations with start/end dates)
- Recommendations (based on borrowing history â€“ Strategy Pattern)
